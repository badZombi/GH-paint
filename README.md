# Basic usage:

Create an pixel image (will give pallette details here in a bit)

    tool I used: https://www.pixilart.com/draw


Create an empty repo in github and copy the url e.g. `git@github.com:badZombi/2022-artwork.git`


select a date you want your artwork to begin, e.g. 01-02-2022

the tool will select the appropriate Sunday to start drawing on for that week.

Run the command and point to the image you created:

`python doit.py -y=2022 -m=1 -d=2 -i=images/gh2.png -r=git@github.com:badZombi/2022-artwork.git`


will add more detail later when I clean up the messy code
